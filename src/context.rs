/// Error type for when an error has been reported to ParseContext.
///
/// It's OK to discard this kind of error and return success. See
/// `ParseContext` for an example.
pub struct Reported;

/// Contains the source text we're parsing and tracks errors.
///
/// We track errors in the ParseContext, not Results, because often a parser
/// produces both a successful match *and* the error that will later prove to
/// be the best error message for the overall parse attempt.
///
/// # The `:wq` example
///
/// For example, consider `parser!(line(u32)+)` parsing the following input:
///
/// ```text
/// 1
/// 2
/// 3
/// 4:wq
/// 5
/// ```
///
/// Clearly, someone accidentally typed `:wq` on line 4. But what will happen
/// here is that `line(u32)+` successfully matches the first 3 lines. If we
/// don't track the error we encountered when trying to parse `5:wq` as a
/// `u32`, but content ourselves with the successful match `line(u32)+`
/// produces, the best error message we can ultimately produce is something
/// like "found extra text after a successful match at line 4, column 1".
///
/// Here's how we now handle these success-failures:
///
/// -   `u32` returns success, matching `4`.
///
/// -   `line(u32)` reports an error to the context (at line 4 column 2) and
///      returns `Reported`, because `u32` didn't match the entire line.
///
/// -   `line(u32)+` then *discards* the `Reported` error, backtracks,
///     and returns a successful match for the first 3 lines.
///
/// -   The top-level parser sees that `line(u32)+` didn't match the entire
///     input, and reports an error to the context at line 4 column 1.
///     But we already have a previous error where we had got further,
///     so this error is ignored.
///
/// -   The error at line 4 column 2 is taken from the context and returned to
///     the user.
///
/// # Rationale: Design alternatives
///
/// To implement this without `ParseContext`, we could have implemented a
/// `TigerResult<T, E>` type that can be `Ok(T)`, `Err(E)`, or `OkBut(T, E)`,
/// the last containing *both* a success value *and* an excuse explaining why
/// we did not succeed even more. The forwardmost error would be propagated
/// there instead of being stored in the context. We would use `TigerResult<T,
/// ParseError>` instead of `Result<T, Reported>` everywhere. Both ways have
/// advantages. Both are pretty weird for Rust. The way of the context is
/// something I've wanted to explore in Rust; and it lets us keep using the `?`
/// try operator.
